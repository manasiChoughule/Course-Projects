# Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning Models

The goal of this analysis is to determine which characteristics are most useful in predicting whether a cancer is malignant or benign as well as to identify broad trends that could help us choose the right model and hyperparameters. Identifying whether a breast cancer is benign or aggressive is the objective. In order to accomplish this, I fitted a function that can predict the discrete class of future input using machine learning classification algorithms.
