# Recognizing Covid-19 Impact on YouTube Trending Video

-- I have chosen the YouTube dataset for United States(2017) which shows the daily statistics for videos. YouTube is the most viewed video platform of all. People search different types of videos according to their area of interests and the monitoring system provides them suggestion according to the interests.

-- So, I planned to build the model which can show what categories people use to view more before COVID and how COVID changed the viewing pattern of people all over the world.

-- Also, I would like to highlight what all parameters affects the video to be trending or to be on the feature list.

-- For example, Title of the video, or comment count on the video if they contain some good keywords it impacts in making the video popular. The channel subscriber size or the number of videos posted on the particular  channel affects the video trending patterns.
