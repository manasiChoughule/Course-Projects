# Recognizing Covid-19 Impact on YouTube Trending Video

We have picked a dataset of daily records of top trending YouTube videos for our project and will analyze what factors affect making the video a trending video. Also will find out the difference in the trends of records before and after COVID-19 trends. Each user has various areas of interest and whenever they open the application, they will find trending suggestions according to the videos they viewed before. That is how the monitoring of the application helps the users to have better experiences and the brands improve their strategies to make customer experiences more relevant and efficient.

While we were searching for our dataset, we did some extra research to find out how and what parameters make video trending. We discovered that comment counts on video result in high ranking, video length has a huge impact, views on the video, subscriber size of a channel, likes for a video, if a video drives a subscriber to the channel, keyword match for the video titles. All these parameters have an impact on making a video trending.
## Objectives

The objective of the project is to analyze the dataset and monitor it to find the conclusion about
how COVID-19 impacted the YouTube business.
- What all parameters affect the dataset in making the videos tending or vice versa.
- Retrieving the video which is most viewed.
- Finding the video which has the highest count of comments.
- Finding the most disliked video.
- Finding the most liked video.
- Finding the major difference in categories viewed by users during and after the pandemic.
## Conclusions

The project’s key aim was to explore the data and use powerful visualizations to discover
interesting statistics and patterns. The main takeaways from the data which we found are:
1. The minimum view count of videos on the trending list increased from amid the covid to after the covid.
2. After the covid, the maximum view count of the trending video almost dropped to half of the view count during the covid.
3. Covid has also impacted the view count distribution. More distribution is seen in 2020 than in 2021.
4. There is also a change in most watched video categories due to covid. In 2021 the most-watched category got shifted to entertainment from music in 2020. In 2021, News & Politics raised a few positions in the trending category list whereas science & technology moved down a few positions.
5. During the covid, the description would be between 1000 to 3000 of the most trended videos. This range got shifted from 0 to 2200 after covid duration.
6. Trending videos have the first three most used tags the same for both the duration. The fourth most used got changed from ‘2020’ during covid to ‘Minecraft’ post covid. 
7. Post covid, the same video is trending for more days.
8. For both the duration, the title length remains the same for trending videos.
