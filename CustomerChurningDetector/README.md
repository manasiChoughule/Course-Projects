## Customer Churning Detector

In this section, you must think of at least 5 relevant questions that explore the relationship between `canceled_service` and the other variables in the `telecom_df` data set. The goal of your analysis should be discovering which variables drive the differences between customers who do and do not cancel their service.

You must answer each question and provide supporting data summaries with either a summary data frame (using `dplyr`/`tidyr`) or a plot (using `ggplot`) or both.

In total, you must have a minimum of 3 plots (created with `ggplot`) and 3 summary data frames (created with `dplyr`) for the exploratory data analysis section. Among the plots you produce, you must have at least 3 different types (ex. box plot, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot, etc...)
