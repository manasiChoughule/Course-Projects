## Overview

Welcome to the Auto Insurance Data Analysis Project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of auto insurance claims data. By leveraging data-driven insights, we seek to inform strategic decision-making within the automobile insurance industry.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this data analysis is to derive actionable insights that contribute to the company's profitability and operational efficiency. By identifying patterns, trends, and factors that impact claims and customer behavior, we aim to make informed recommendations for pricing optimization, customer retention strategies, and policy enhancements.

## Dataset

The dataset (`claims_df.rds`) comprises 6,249 auto insurance claims. Each entry in the dataset represents a unique claim and includes a range of attributes encompassing customer demographics, policy specifics, claims details, and more.

## Technology Stack

- R Programming Language
- Tidyverse Libraries (ggplot2, dplyr, etc.)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Through a rigorous EDA process, we delve into the data to answer key questions and uncover insights that inform our recommendations. Our analysis covers the following areas:

1. Gender and marital status impact claim rates.
2. Identification of highly profitable customer segments.
3. Relationship between education, income, and residential type for profitable customers.
4. Evaluation of "problem customers" with frequent claims.
5. Analysis of loss contribution from specific car categories and sales channels.
6. Assessment of vehicle class profitability and sales channel influence.
7. Determining customer loyalty among highly profitable clients.
8. Identification of loss-making customer segments.

## Key Findings and Recommendations

Based on our comprehensive analysis, here are the key findings and corresponding recommendations:

### Findings

- Marital status affects claim rates, with married clients exhibiting higher rates.
- California records the highest number of claims, warranting premium adjustments.
- Educated customers within specific income brackets and residential types are more profitable.
- "Problem customers" with frequent claims have a significant impact on losses.
- Certain car categories and sales channels contribute more to losses.
- Luxury SUVs and luxury cars are the most profitable vehicle classes.
- Long-term customers tend to be more profitable.
- New clients make up a significant portion of "problem customers."

### Recommendations

1. Tailor premium structures for married clients to account for increased claim rates.
2. Target premium adjustments in states with high claim frequencies, such as California.
3. Expand coverage options for corporate clients to enhance profitability.
4. Offer incentives and customized policies for highly profitable customer segments.
5. Implement proactive monitoring and intervention strategies for customers with multiple claims.
6. Invest in agent and branch training to improve customer engagement and retention.
7. Focus on customer retention strategies to maintain loyalty and profitability.
8. Develop targeted risk assessment and mitigation strategies for identified loss-making segments.
